# SciPyProject

# this script processes csv files generated by a software called Neuronstdio, in which dendritic spines in confocal images were manually reconstructed. 
# the aim of the experiment is to see whether pathogenic antibodies isolated from patients affect neuronal morphology, namely post-synapses.
# mice were chronicly infused with these antibodies targeting NMDAR and cauing its downregulation. There are two groups: control antibody and NMDAR antibody.
# Data is organized in folder 'data' containing subfolders representing the experimental groups, each group contains subfolders representing a mouse.
